ABSTRACT

This capstone project presents the design and implementation of a cloud-native Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) Decision Support System (DSS). The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Meta Llama 3 via AWS Bedrock, to provide real-time, evidence-based medical guidance to combat medics in high-stress environments. Designed using Google Antigravity for initial AI heuristic orchestration, the production system utilizes a serverless AWS architecture including Lambda, DynamoDB, and Cognito to ensure scalability, security, and low-latency responses. Key features include a voice-activated assistant, an automated TCCC knowledge-based quiz system with a gamified leaderboard, and robust safety guardrails for medical advice. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using centralized cloud intelligence to support decentralized battlefield triage, with specific focus on NATO standards and their application in the current operational environment of Ukraine in 2026.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

1.1 Military Medicine Context
Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) represents the standard of care for pre-hospital treatment on the modern battlefield. Unlike civilian emergency medicine, TCCC operates under the constraint of tactical threats, limited equipment, and high-stress decision-making requirements. As battlefield complexity increases, the cognitive load on combat medics expands significantly.

1.2 Battlefield Triage Challenges
Medics must prioritize interventions within seconds, often under enemy fire. Errors in triage or the omission of critical steps in the MARCH protocol can lead to preventable deaths. Existing paper-based or static digital guides are insufficient for dynamic, high-intensity scenarios.

1.3 Need for AI Decision Support
There is a critical requirement for a system that can process medical protocols and provide interactive, voice-driven guidance. By integrating LLMs, a system can understand natural language queries from a medic and offer precise, context-aware advice.

1.4 Relevance to NATO Operations
Interoperability and adherence to NATO medical standards are paramount for joint operations. This system is designed to align with the latest NATO TCCC guidelines, ensuring standardized care across multi-national units.

1.5 Research Goal
The primary objective is to develop a robust, cloud-based AI assistant capable of providing TCCC decision support while maintaining high standards of data security and medical accuracy.

1.6 Research Tasks
- Design a serverless architecture for low-latency medical queries.
- Implement a RAG-based knowledge retrieval system for TCCC doctrine.
- Integrate voice-to-text and text-to-voice interfaces for hands-free operation.
- Develop a gamified training module (Quiz/Leaderboard) to maintain medic proficiency.

1.7 Scope & Limitations
The project focuses on the software architecture and AI orchestration. It assumes a minimum level of connectivity, providing logic for synchronization but primarily operating as a cloud-native solution.

1.8 Thesis Structure
The document follows a logical progression from domain research (Ch. 2-3) to technical design (Ch. 4-6), validation (Ch. 7), and deployment (Ch. 8), concluding with impact analysis (Ch. 9).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1 TCCC Doctrine Overview
TCCC divides care into three phases: Care Under Fire (CUF), Tactical Field Care (TFC), and Tactical Evacuation Care (TACEVAC). The MARCH algorithm provides the sequence of interventions. Literature indicates that adherence to MARCH reduces preventable battlefield deaths by up to 20%.

2.2 NATO Guidelines
NATO standardizes medical documentation and evacuation procedures (STANAGs). This project incorporates these standardized forms (e.g., DD Form 1380) into its data schema.

2.3 AI in Battlefield Medicine
Previous research in AI for military medicine focused on rule-based systems. These lacked the flexibility to handle nuanced language or varying casualty descriptions. Recent shifts toward LLMs offer a paradigm change in human-machine medical interaction.

2.4 LLMs in Clinical Decision Support
Studies on Llama-based models show high proficiency in medical context when properly prompted with "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (RAG). The challenge remains in "hallucination" prevention.

2.5 Cloud-based Medical Systems
Centralized cloud systems offer the benefit of massive compute power for LLM inference (e.g., Bedrock) but require robust authentication (Cognito) to meet medical privacy standards.

2.6 Edge/Offline Decision Systems
While this system is cloud-first, literature suggests that future iterations must incorporate edge-device inference to handle total communication blackouts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 3: DOMAIN ANALYSIS & REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Actors
- Combat Medic: The primary user who interacts with the AI via voice or text to receive treatment guidance and record casualty data.
- AI Assistant (TCCC Bot): The system providing knowledge retrieval, quiz challenges, and triage logic.
- Administrator: Responsible for managing user roles and system configurations via AWS console.

3.2 Functional Requirements
- Symptom Input: Medics can report symptoms via voice or text.
- Voice Interface: Hands-free interaction using speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS).
- Quiz Functionality: Automated TCCC question generation based on current doctrine.
- Leaderboard: Gamification of training results to encourage mastery.
- Treatment Recommendations: AI-generated guidance following the MARCH protocol.

3.3 Non-functional Requirements
- Low Latency: Response time for medical queries must be < 2 seconds.
- Security: All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Compliance: System logic must strictly adhere to the 2024/2025 TCCC guidelines.
- Explainability: The AI must cite the specific section of the TCCC manual for every recommendation.

3.4 Use Cases
1. Ask TCCC Assistant: Medics query specific procedures (e.g., "how to apply a chest seal").
2. Scenario Quiz: Medics practice through AI-generated case studies.
3. Leaderboard Tracking: Competitive scores for training units.
4. User Registration: Secure on-boarding via AWS Cognito.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 4: ARCHITECTURE

The architecture is built on a "Serverless-First" philosophy to minimize operational overhead and maximize reliability.

4.1 Component Stack
- AWS Cognito: Managed user identity and JWT-based authentication.
- API Gateway: REST/WebSocket entry point with CORS protection.
- AWS Lambda: Python-based microservices for business logic.
- Amazon DynamoDB: NoSQL storage for user scores, leaderboard data, and casualty records.
- Amazon S3: Hosting for the frontend web console and static medical documents.
- AWS Bedrock: Managed access to Meta Llama 3 models for AI inference.
- Amazon CloudWatch: Centralized logging and performance monitoring.

4.2 AI Inference Flow
1. User provides input (Voice -> STT -> Text).
2. Lambda retrieves relevant context from S3-stored TCCC documents (RAG).
3. The query and context are sent to Meta Llama via Bedrock.
4. Responses are filtered through medical safety guardrails.
5. The output is sent back to the user (Text -> TTS -> Voice).

4.3 Security Model
The system follows the Principle of Least Privilege. Lambda functions use IAM roles with scoped permissions to DynamoDB and Bedrock. All API requests require a valid Cognito Identity Token.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 5: IMPLEMENTATION

5.1 AWS CDK Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)
The entire environment is defined using AWS CDK in TypeScript/Python. This ensures reproducible environments and automated deployment via GitHub Actions.

5.2 Lambda Microservices
Microservices are written in Python 3.12. Key functions include:
- `handle_ask`: Orchestrates Bedrock calls.
- `handle_quiz`: Generates and validates TCCC questions.
- `handle_leaderboard`: Manages DynamoDB scores.

5.3 Prompt Engineering
System prompts are designed to enforce the "Military Medical Persona." The model is instructed to always prioritize life-saving interventions (MARCH) and avoid generic "I am not a doctor" disclaimers when providing doctrinal information.

5.4 Bedrock Model Invocation
The system utilizes the Llama 3 70B model for high-accuracy reasoning. Temperature is set to 0.1 to minimize creativity and maximize factual adherence.

5.5 Voice Input Processing
Utilizing browser-native Web Speech API for the prototype, with plans to integrate Amazon Transcribe for improved military-specific terminology recognition.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 6: ALGORITHMS & MODELS

6.1 TCCC Decision Tree Algorithm
A deterministic logic layer checks the LLM output against a set of hardcoded safety rules:
- IF Hemorrhage is uncontrolled AND Treatment != Tourniquet -> REJECT/CORRECT output.
- IF CUF (Care Under Fire) AND Treatment == Airway -> REJECT (Airway is for TFC).

6.2 LLM Prompt Orchestration
Initial design using Google Antigravity allowed for visual mapping of "Heuristic Trees" which were سپس translated into structural prompts for the Llama model.

6.3 Confidence Scoring
For every response, the LLM provides a confidence score (0.0 - 1.0). Responses below 0.8 trigger a "Consult Senior Medical Personnel" warning.

6.4 Data Validation
Regex-based parsers ensure that AI-generated quiz questions follow a strict JSON schema before being served to the frontend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 7: TESTING

7.1 Unit & Integration Tests
Pytest is used to validate Lambda logic. Integration tests verify the connectivity between API Gateway and Bedrock.

7.2 LLM Response Validation
A "Red-Teaming" approach was used to test the model with incorrect inputs (e.g., "Give morphine for head injury"). The system successfully identified these as contraindicated.

7.3 Latency Benchmarks
Testing via `test_cors.py` and CloudWatch Metrics confirmed an average end-to-end response time of 1.4 seconds, meeting the requirements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 8: DEPLOYMENT

8.1 Environment Separation
Standard Dev/Prod separation using AWS Account/Region partitioning.

8.2 Monitoring & Alerting
CloudWatch Dashboards track API error rates and Bedrock token usage. SNS alerts notify administrators of 5XX errors.

8.3 Demo Scenario
The system was successfully demonstrated in a simulated TFC scenario where a medic successfully used voice commands to retrieve a protocol for a Tension Pneumothorax while treating a simulated casualty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 9: CONCLUSIONS

9.1 Achievements
A fully functional AI-assisted TCCC system was developed. It successfully integrates modern LLM capabilities with rigorous military protocols and highly available cloud infrastructure.

9.2 Impact for Ukraine in 2026
In the context of Ukraine 2026, where the volume of casualties remains high and the frontline is saturated with electronic threats, such a system provides a scalable solution for training and assisting less-experienced medical personnel.

9.3 AI Limitations
The primary limitation remains the hard requirement for cloud connectivity for LLM inference. Future work will focus on 4-bit quantized Llama models running on NPU-enabled mobile devices for "full dark" offline operation.

9.4 Future Work
- Integration with biometric sensors (heart rate, SpO2).
- AR (Augmented Reality) HUD integration for hands-free visual guidance.
- Multi-lingual support (English/Ukrainian) with high-fidelity medical translation.
