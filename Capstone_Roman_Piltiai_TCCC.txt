ABSTRACT

The integration of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) into frontline medical operations represents a pivotal shift in modern military doctrine. This thesis explores the design and implementation of a Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) AI Decision Support System, engineered to provide real-time guidance to combat medics during high-intensity operations. Utilizing a cloud-native, serverless architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)—specifically Meta Llama via AWS Bedrock—to assist in triage, procedure enforcement (MARCH protocol), and casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) prioritization. 

The research addresses the chronic challenge of medic cognitive overload and decision fatigue under battlefield stress. Initially designed using the Google Antigravity framework for heuristic orchestration, the production solution utilizes AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and Cognito to ensure low-latency, secure, and scalable responses. The thesis details the software architecture, the development of specialized prompt engineering for medical triage, and the implementation of a voice-activated interface designed for austere environments. Validation through performance benchmarks and simulated medical scenarios demonstrates that the system achieves high accuracy in protocol adherence and significantly reduces the time required for casualty data registration. The findings offer a roadmap for the deployment of AI medical assistants in multi-domain operations, particularly highlighting their impact in current operational conditions.

CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION

1.1 Industry Context

In the landscape of modern warfare, particularly as observed in the high-intensity conflicts of 2026, the speed and accuracy of medical intervention on the battlefield have become the primary determinants of personnel survival rates. Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) has long served as the gold standard for pre-hospital trauma care, providing a structured approach to managing life-threatening injuries. However, the shift toward multi-domain operations and the increased use of unmanned systems and long-range precision fires have created complex casualty scenarios that often overwhelm the traditional manual processes of frontline medics.

The industry surrounding military medical technology is currently undergoing a radical digital transformation. Historically reliant on paper-based TCCC cards and static training manuals, defense medical agencies are now seeking to integrate high-technology sensors, wearable monitors, and advanced analytical software. This shift is driven by the realization that "the golden hour"—the critical period for providing life-saving care—is often compressed or made inaccessible by ongoing tactical threats. Consequently, providing the medic with a "digital brain" or a decision support system has moved from a conceptual luxury to a combat necessity.

Furthermore, the personnel involved in these operations are increasingly diverse in their training levels. From elite Special Operations Combat Medics (SOCM) to unit-level combat lifesavers, the requirement for a standardized, expert-level consultation at the point of injury is constant. The rise of cloud computing and low-latency satellite communications (such as Starlink) has finally enabled the delivery of sophisticated AI intelligence to the tactical edge, allowing for centralized knowledge to support decentralized medical operations.

1.2 Problem Statement

Despite the rigorous training provided to combat medics, the cognitive load experienced during a Mass Casualty (MASCAL) event or a high-stress "Care Under Fire" scenario leads to measurable declines in decision-making accuracy. Statistics from recent operational theaters suggest that preventable deaths frequently occur because of deviations from the established MARCH protocol—specifically in the timing of tourniquet application, the identification of tension pneumothorax, or the inadequate management of hypothermia. The human medic, facing sensory overload and extreme physical fatigue, is susceptible to bias and the omission of critical assessment steps.

Existing digital tools in this domain are largely descriptive rather than prescriptive. While there are mobile applications that store PDF versions of the TCCC guidelines, they require manual navigation and reading, which is impossible for a medic whose hands are occupied with wound packing or airway management. There is a lack of a truly proactive, voice-activated assistant that can listen to the medic’s observations and provide immediate, context-aware treatment steps according to the latest medical data and tactical phase.

Furthermore, the documentation of care remains a significant bottleneck. Medics are required to complete a TCCC card (DD Form 1380) under stress, often resulting in illegible or incomplete records that complicate the handover to the Tactical Evacuation (TACEVAC) team. Without a structured, electronic way to capture demographic and clinical data automatically during the intervention, the continuity of care is fragmented, increasing the risk of medical errors during the subsequent phases of the casualty’s journey through the evacuation chain.

1.3 Relevance of the Topic

The relevance of an AI-driven TCCC decision support system is underscored by the current geopolitical and military climate. Within NATO, the emphasis on Large Scale Combat Operations (LSCO) has highlighted the need for systems that can scale rapidly and handle high casualty volumes. As joint operations become the norm, maintaining a singular, AI-enforced standard of care across diverse units ensures that casualties receive the same high-quality interventions regardless of the unit they are attached to.

In the specific context of the war in Ukraine in 2026, the technological frontier has moved toward integrated "battlefield clouds." The Ukrainian medical forces have consistently demonstrated that the rapid adoption of consumer-grade and cloud-native technology can provide a decisive edge. A system that integrates Bedrock and Meta Llama to offer medical guidance in real-time is not merely a theoretical exercise; it is a direct response to the need for enhancing the survivability of soldiers on the most contested battlefields in modern history.

Finally, the ethical and legal implications of medical AI are at the forefront of defense research. By developing a system that prioritizes explainability and audit logging, this research contributes to the broader discussion on how AI can be safely integrated into life-critical systems. The project serves as a foundational model for how restricted-domain LLMs can be utilized to augment human expertise without replacing the critical "human-in-the-loop" oversight required for medical ethics.

1.4 Research Goal

The primary goal of this capstone research is to design, implement, and validate a cloud-native, voice-activated TCCC Decision Support System. The system must be capable of parsing natural language medical reports, enforcing the MARCH protocol through AI-driven heuristics, and providing contextually relevant treatment recommendations. It aims to reduce the medic’s cognitive burden while ensuring that casualty data is captured accurately and shared across the evacuation chain in a secure, serverless environment.

1.5 Research Tasks

To achieve the stated research goal, the following specific tasks must be completed:
1. Conduct a domain analysis of TCCC protocols and identify the critical decision points where AI intervention is most effective.
2. Design a high-availability, serverless architecture on AWS that supports authenticated access, data persistence, and low-latency AI inference.
3. Perform prompt engineering for the Meta Llama model on AWS Bedrock to create a "Tactical Medical Persona" that adheres strictly to CoTCCC guidelines.
4. Integrate a voice-recognition interface that allows for hands-free operation in battlefield-like environments.
5. Create a gamified education and validation module, including a quiz system and leaderboard, to ensure the AI's training data aligns with medic expectations.
6. Validate the system through simulated casualty scenarios and performance testing, focusing on response time, accuracy of advice, and data security.

1.6 Scope and Limitations

The scope of this thesis is focused on the architectural design and the AI logic orchestration of the TCCC assistant. It encompasses the web-based console, the Lambda microservices, the integration with AWS Bedrock, and the security configuration using Cognito and IAM. The project specifically targets the "Tactical Field Care" and "Tactical Evacuation Care" phases, where the medic has more cognitive bandwidth for interaction than in the "Care Under Fire" phase.

Limitations of the research include the reliance on cloud connectivity for the primary LLM inference. While an offline fallback logic is described, the full power of the Meta Llama 70B model requires active satellite or cellular communication. Furthermore, the voice recognition component is tested in a semi-controlled environment and may require further optimization for high-noise battlefield backgrounds. Finally, while the system provides treatment recommendations, it is designed as a "Decision Support" tool, not an autonomous medical device; final clinical responsibility remains with the human practitioner.

1.7 Structure of the Thesis

This thesis is organized into nine chapters. Chapter 2 provides a literature review of existing military medical systems and AI research. Chapter 3 analyzes the domain and defines the functional and non-functional requirements. Chapter 4 details the software architecture and the AWS component integration. Chapter 5 focuses on the technological implementation and the usage of Infrastructure as Code. Chapter 6 describes the core algorithms and the AI models utilized. Chapter 7 covers the testing and validation procedures. Chapter 8 outlines the deployment strategy. Finally, Chapter 9 concludes with an analysis of the system's impact and suggestions for future research.

CHAPTER 2 – LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1 Overview of TCCC Systems

The development of Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) systems has evolved through three distinct generations. The first generation was characterized by physical media—waterproof cards and field manuals that provided a structured checklist for medical interventions. While durable, these systems lacked any form of intelligent assistance and placed the entire burden of memory and interpretation on the medic. Literature from the early 2000s reflects the success of these protocols in reducing mortality but simultaneously highlights the failure to follow them correctly during the high-stress phases of a firefight.

The second generation introduced digital digitization in the form of standalone mobile applications and localized databases. These systems allowed for structured data entry and provided interactive "IF-THEN" wizards based on static decision trees. However, as noted in various defense technology assessments, these applications were often hindered by poor user interfaces and the requirement for manual touch input, which is impractical for a medic wearing tactical gloves and dealing with bodily fluids. The lack of connectivity also meant that casualty data remained siloed on the device until much later in the evacuation process.

The current, third generation, of which this project is a part, focuses on integrated intelligence and ambient computing. Recent academic publications emphasize the role of "Medical Digital Twins" and real-time decision support systems that use sensors and AI to provide proactive guidance. The shift toward these systems is empowered by advancements in low-power wide-area networks and the democratization of high-performance computing through cloud service providers. This research builds upon the foundation of these generations, moving from a static checklist to a dynamic, natural language dialogue.

2.2 Cloud-native medical platforms

The application of cloud-native architecture in the medical domain has traditionally been focused on civilian hospital information systems (HIS). These systems prioritize high availability and data durability, often utilizing complex microservices to handle patient scheduling, billing, and diagnostic imaging. However, military research has recently identified that these same architectural principles can be applied to tactical medicine to solve the "last mile" connectivity problem. By using serverless computing (Functions as a Service), medical platforms can scale instantaneously to handle a sudden influx of casualty reports during a combined arms operation.

Cloud-native platforms offer unique advantages in terms of "Elasticity" and "Resilience." In a battlefield scenario where the infrastructure may be degraded or under cyber-attack, the ability of a platform to self-heal and distribute its workload across multiple regions is critical. Literature on cloud-native medical engineering suggests that the decouplings of the presentation layer from the business logic layer allows for "Thin Client" deployments at the edge, where limited hardware resources can still benefit from the massive compute power of the cloud.

Moreover, the integration of managed services (such as S3 for document storage or DynamoDB for real-time state management) reduces the maintenance burden on military IT departments. This allows for a "Focus on Logic, Not Infrastructure" approach, which is essential for rapid deployment in emerging conflict zones. This thesis leverages these AWS paradigms to create a system that is as much a study in resilient infrastructure as it is in medical AI, ensuring that the assistant remains available when the tactical situation is most dire.

2.3 Military identity & access control

Security in military medical systems is significantly more complex than in civilian counterparts. The identity of the medic, the rank-based authority to access certain medical procedures (e.g., surgical cricothyroidotomy vs. needle decompression), and the high sensitivity of casualty rosters require a granular access control model. Academic research into "Zero Trust Architecture" for tactical networks has identified that identity must be verified at every step of the data flow, using decentralized and cryptographically secure methods.

AWS Cognito has emerged in the literature as a robust solution for handling OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity flows in environments where traditional Active Directory services are not feasible. By using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), a military medical system can ensure that every API request to the backend is authenticated and authorized according to the medic's unit and role. This project utilizes Cognito to enforce these strict boundaries, ensuring that casualty data "Need-to-Know" principles are maintained throughout the system lifecycle.

Furthermore, the auditability of access is a legal requirement under both international humanitarian law and domestic military regulations. Every action taken by a medic—and every recommendation provided by the AI—must be linked to a verified identity. Literature on "Blockchain for Medical Audit" has explored decentralized ledgers, but for the scope of this research, a high-fidelity audit trail implemented via DynamoDB Streams and CloudWatch is shown to provide the necessary transparency for after-action reviews and medical accountability.

2.4 Event-driven medical systems

The asynchronous nature of battlefield events—ranging from a sudden casualty report to the arrival of an evacuation helicopter—makes the event-driven architecture (EDA) particularly suited for TCCC applications. Unlike monolithic systems that rely on polling, an EDA-based system reacts immediately to state changes. For example, the moment a casualty’s status is updated to "Urgent Surgical," an event can be triggered to notify the receiving surgical team and update the CASEVAC priority queue.

Previous studies on EDA in healthcare have demonstrated that using an "Event Mesh" can significantly reduce the latency between diagnosis and treatment. In this project, the use of AWS Lambda functions that are triggered by API Gateway requests or DynamoDB changes creates a highly responsive environment. This architecture allows the system to remain "Idle" (saving costs and power) until a medical event occurs, at which point it can provision the necessary compute resources to process an complex AI clinical query.

The resilience provided by EDA is also a key factor. If one component of the medical chain fails (e.g., the telemetry processing service), the event can be queued (using services like SQS or EventBridge) until the component is restored. This ensures that no casualty data is lost during periods of network instability. This research explores these asynchronous patterns to create a "Message-First" medical assistant that maintains the continuity of information even when the communication links are intermittent.

2.5 AI & LLMs in battlefield medicine

The most significant research gap in TCCC technology is the transition from deterministic "Decision Trees" to probabilistic "Large Language Models." Traditional expert systems were rigid and failed when the medic’s input did not perfectly match the expected syntax. In contrast, LLMs trained on medical corpora have shown an incredible ability to extract clinical meaning from messy, natural language descriptions. Research into "Transformers in Trauma" suggests that LLMs can provide a level of nuanced reasoning that was previously only available from senior medical officers.

The implementation of LLMs on the battlefield is currently centered around the "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (RAG) pattern. This approach, which this thesis adopts, involves feeding the model a curated set of TCCC guidelines (the "Knowledge Base") alongside the user's query. This minimizes the risk of hallucinations—where the model might invent incorrect medical steps—by forcing it to ground its responses in the provided authoritative text. Academic studies on Meta Llama 70B indicate that it performs exceptionally well in these structured retrieval tasks, often outperforming human medical students in standardized trauma exams.

However, the "Black Box" nature of AI remains a challenge. For a medic to trust an AI’s recommendation to perform a high-risk procedure, the system must provide "Chain-of-Thought" reasoning. Literature emphasizes that medical AI must be "Explainable" (XAI). This research implements prompt engineering strategies that require the Llama model to cite its sources and explain its logic based on the MARCH protocol. By doing so, the AI acts as a peer-reviewer for the medic's plan, enhancing safety rather than replacing human judgment.

2.6 Summary & research gaps

While there is a wealth of information on TCCC protocols and an increasing amount of research into LLMs, there is a distinct lack of documented implementations of a fully integrated, cloud-native TCCC assistant that spans from voice input to secure database persistence. Most existing studies are either purely medical (focusing on protocol efficacy) or purely technical (focusing on LLM benchmarks), with very little "Architectural Synthesis" that addresses the unique constraints of the 2026 tactical environment.

This project addresses this gap by presenting a complete, end-to-end solution. It combines the rigor of CoTCCC medicine with the flexibility of serverless AI. The following chapters detail how this synthesis is achieved, moving from the conceptual requirements to the final deployment and validation of a system that can truly support a medic in the most challenging conditions on earth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 3 – DOMAIN ANALYSIS & REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Domain Description

The domain of Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) is defined by its three distinct phases of care, each with its own set of medical priorities and tactical constraints. In Phase 1: Care Under Fire (CUF), the medical objective is limited to the application of a limb tourniquet for life-threatening hemorrhage, as the tactical priority is to suppress the enemy and prevent further casualties. In Phase 2: Tactical Field Care (TFC), the threat has been suppressed or moved, allowing for a more thorough assessment using the MARCH algorithm. Phase 3: Tactical Evacuation (TACEVAC) occurs during transport to a higher level of care, where additional resources and stability allow for more complex monitoring and interventions.

This research focuses on providing decision support primarily during the TFC and TACEVAC phases. During these stages, the medic must perform deep clinical triage: managing airways (A), treating tension pneumothorax (R), assessing for internal bleeding (C), and preventing traumatic brain injury and hypothermia (H). The domain is further characterized by "The Fog of War"—high levels of stress, fatigue, and sensory deprivation that can lead to protocol deviation. An AI assistant in this domain must be able to understand the current phase of care and adjust its advice accordingly, ensuring that medical interventions remain tactically sound.

The domain also involves a complex data lifecycle. A casualty report begins as an ambient "Observation" from the medic, which must then be converted into a structured "Medical Record." This record must then be prioritized into a "CASEVAC Request" (9-Line) and finally handed over to a surgical team. The interdependencies between these data states require a system that understands the "Medical Context" of the battlefield, recognizing when a patient is deteriorating and when a life-saving intervention is being neglected.

3.2 Stakeholders and Actors

The primary Actor in this system is the Combat Medic (or Combat Lifesaver). This user is typically at the point of injury, wearing tactical gear, and operating under significant stress. Their interaction with the system is characterized by a need for "Hands-Free" and "Eyes-Off" support. The medic provides the "Clinical Observations" and receives the "Treatment Recommendations." They are the ultimate decision-maker, using the AI as an expert consultant to verify their MARCH assessment and ensure no steps are missed.

The AI Assistant (TCCC Bot) is the secondary, autonomous actor. It resides in the AWS cloud and is "Invoked" via the medic's interface. It acts as a "Guardian" of the medical protocols, processing the medic's voice or text inputs against its knowledge base of TCCC guidelines. Its role is to analyze the data, detect contradictions (e.g., a "Correct" answer in a quiz or a "Wrong" dosage in a recommendation), and provide immediate feedback. It also manages the "Training Arena," where it generates realistic scenario-based quizzes to keep the medic's skills sharp during downtime.

Auxiliary stakeholders include the Commanding Officers and the Receiving Medical Facilities. For the commander, the system provides a "Medical Common Operating Picture" (MEDCOP), showing the status and location of casualties across the unit (anonymized where necessary). For the receiving hospital, the system provides a digital "Heads-Up" of the casualty's condition and the treatments already performed, allowing the surgical team to prepare the operating room before the helicopter even lands. These stakeholders benefit from the "Continuity of Information" that the serverless backend provides.

3.3 Functional Requirements

The core functional requirement is "Context-Aware Medical Querying." The system must allow the medic to ask natural language questions (e.g., "What is the procedure for an open chest wound?") and receive an answer based exclusively on the 2024/2025 CoTCCC guidelines. This requires the integration of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine that can extract snippets from PDF manuals and feed them into the Meta Llama 3 model. The responses must be concise, highlighting the primary MARCH action required.

A second critical function is the "Voice-to-JSON Parsing Engine." When a medic reports a casualty (e.g., "Male soldier, gunshot wound to thigh, heavy bleeding, pulse 120"), the system must use the LLM to parse this unstructured sentence into a structured JSON object. This object is then used to populate the TCCC card in DynamoDB and trigger the "MARCH Heuristics" to check if a tourniquet has been applied. This automated data extraction is the primary mechanism for reducing the medic's administrative burden.

Additional functional requirements include the "Automated Scenario Quiz" and the "Gamified Leaderboard." The system must be able to generate a unique quiz question by sampling the TCCC knowledge base and creating three plausible distractors. The "Leaderboard" must track the scores of all users in a unit, providing a competitive ranking to incentivize training. Finally, a "Secure Authentication" module using Cognito is required to ensure that only authorized military personnel can access the triage data and treatment records.

3.4 Non-functional Requirements

"Latency" is the most critical non-functional requirement. In a life-or-death situation, a delay in information is a failure of the system. The target latency for a voice query to receive a medical response is < 1.5 seconds. This requires a highly optimized backend, including the use of AWS Lambda "Provisioned Concurrency" to avoid cold starts and the selection of the most efficient model sizing in AWS Bedrock. The system must also support "Streaming Responses" to allow the medic to begin hearing the answer before the entire text is generated.

"Medical Adherence (Accuracy)" is the second priority. The system must have a "Zero Hallucination" tolerance for procedural steps. If the AI is unsure of a procedure, it must default to "I cannot find a specific protocol for this in the TCCC manual; consult a senior medic." This is achieved through strict prompt conditioning and a validation layer that checks the LLM's output against a set of deterministic medical rules (e.g., "Always recommend tourniquet for arterial limb bleed").

"Security and Privacy" are paramount. The system must comply with military data handling standards, ensuring that Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is encrypted at rest using AES-256 and in transit via TLS 1.3. Furthermore, "Explainability" is required for clinical accountability; the AI must provide a "Source ID" or a quote from the TCCC manual for every procedural recommendation it provides. This ensures that the medic can verify the advice if time permits, maintaining trust in the human-machine partnership.

3.5 Constraints & Assumptions

The primary technical constraint is the "Connected Disconnected Intermittent Low-bandwidth" (CDIL) environment. The thesis assumes that while the primary system is cloud-native, the medic has access to a reliable satellite or tactical LTE link. A "Graceful Degradation" constraint is enforced: if the cloud is unreachable, the frontend must cache the last 5 relevant triage protocols for offline display. On the hardware side, the system must be accessible via any modern mobile browser, assuming no specialized proprietary hardware is available at the point of injury.

From a medical standpoint, it is assumed that the medic has completed the basic Combat Lifesaver (CLS) or Medic course. The AI is not intended to teach medicine to a complete novice; it is a "Refresher and Safety Check" for a trained professional. Another assumption is that the system adheres to the NATO 2024 standards, and any updates to the TCCC guidelines will be promptly uploaded to the Knowledge Base to ensure the AI's "Ground Truth" remains current.

3.6 Use Cases

3.7 System Context Diagram

The system context is defined by the interaction between the edge interface and the centralized AWS control plane. The frontend acts as the sensory input (Voice/Text), while the AWS Lambda functions serve as the cognitive processing center, orchestrating calls between the Bedrock Knowledge Bases and the DynamoDB persistence layer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 4 – SOFTWARE DESIGN & ARCHITECTURE

4.1 Architectural Goals

The primary architectural goal of the TCCC Decision Support System is "Service Availability in Sparse Environments." Given the life-critical nature of the application, the system must be designed to withstand failures in individual AWS services or tactical communication nodes. This is achieved through a multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment strategy and the use of serverless components that automatically scale and failover. The architecture prioritizes "Low Latency" for AI inference, as every second spent waiting for a packet return is a second lost in casualty care.

A secondary goal is "Data Sovereignty and Security." In a military context, clinical and demographic data must be protected against both interception and unauthorized access. The architecture enforces "Encryption Everywhere"—utilizing AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for data at rest and TLS for data in transit. Furthermore, the goal is to create a "Federated Medical Record" that can be shared across the NATO medical chain of command while maintaining a strict audit trail of who accessed the data and when.

Finally, the system is designed for "Extensibility." The modular nature of the Lambda microservices and the use of the Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) allow for the rapid addition of new capabilities. For instance, the system can be easily updated to include a "Knowledge Graph" for pharmaceutical interactions or an "IoT Ingestion" layer for real-time biometric sensors without requiring a complete rewrite of the core medical logic.

4.2 High-level AWS architecture

The high-level architecture utilizes a "Request-Response" pattern for interactive queries and an "Event-Driven" pattern for background synchronization and logging. The entry point for all users is a static web application hosted on Amazon S3 and delivered globally through Amazon CloudFront. This ensures that the frontend assets are available at the edge with minimum latency. The application is protected by AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to mitigate common web exploits and DDoS attacks.

The backend is entirely serverless, centered around an AWS API Gateway (HTTP API v2). This acts as the orchestration layer, routing requests to specific AWS Lambda functions based on the endpoint (e.g., `/ask`, `/quiz`, `/score`). These functions are written in Python and utilize the Boto3 SDK to interact with other AWS services. The "Compute" layer is decoupled from the "Storage" layer (DynamoDB) and the "Intelligence" layer (Bedrock), allowing each component to scale independently according to tactical demand.

4.3 Component View

4.3.1 API layer
The API layer provides a secure, RESTful interface for the web console. It enforces JWT-based authentication via an AWS Cognito Authorizer. The API is designed with "Idempotency" in mind, ensuring that if a medic sends the same casualty report twice due to a network glitch, the system recognizes it as a single entry and does not create duplicate medical records.

4.3.2 Lambda microservices
The microservices are partitioned by domain:
- `ClinicalAssistantService`: Handles the complex RAG and Bedrock orchestration.
- `TrainingService`: Manages the generation of quizzes and the validation of user responses.
- `UserPreferenceService`: Stores medic-specific settings, such as language preference and unit affiliation.
- `AuditService`: An asynchronous service that listens to DynamoDB Streams to log all clinical decisions.

4.3.3 Web console
The frontend is built as a Single Page Application (SPA). It uses a "Mobile-First" design approach to ensure usability on tactical tablets and handheld devices. It implements a local state management system (e.g., Redux or Context API) to cache user data and allow for limited offline functionality during intermittent signal loss.

4.3.4 Voice interface
The voice interface utilizes the browser's native `SpeechRecognition` API for capturing the medic's intent. Once captured, the text is sent to the `ClinicalAssistantService`. The response is then returned as text and synthesized back into speech using the `SpeechSynthesis` API. This component is designed with "Noise-Gating" logic to handle the chaotic acoustic environment of a casualty evacuation site.

4.3.5 Event-driven layer
The event layer uses Amazon EventBridge and DynamoDB Streams. When a "Critical Triage Event" occurs, an event is published to the bus. This allows for peripheral actions—such as sending a notification to an ambulance team or generating a PDF TCCC card for physical backup—to occur without blocking the main medical thread.

4.4 Data Model

The data model is implemented in Amazon DynamoDB to leverage its single-digit millisecond performance. It utilizes a "Single-Table Design" pattern to minimize the number of queries required to reconstruct a casualty's history.

- `CasultyTable`: Stores the core medical record (Demographics, MOI, Signs/Symptoms, Treatments).
- `TriageSessions`: Groups medical queries by event ID to maintain a coherent clinical dialogue.
- `Recommendations`: Stores a history of all AI-generated advice for medical oversight.
- `AuditLogs`: A write-ahead log of all user actions, including login, data access, and treatment execution.
- `UserRoles`: Links Cognito IDs to military ranks and medical certifications.

4.5 API Architecture

The API follows a structured schema where every request contains the `casualtyId`, the `medicId`, and the `tacticalContext` (Phase of Care). This allows the backend to provide responses that are not just medically accurate, but "Tactically Sound." For example, if the `tacticalContext` is `Care Under Fire`, the API will automatically prioritize hemorrhage control over airway management in its response ranking.

4.6 Authentication & Authorization

Cognito serves as the Root of Trust. Medics are assigned to "User Pools" based on their specific military unit. "IAM Roles for Tasks" are used to ensure that a Lambda function can only access the specific DynamoDB items belonging to its assigned unit. This implementation prevents cross-tenant data leakage, a critical requirement for military operational security.

4.7 Event-driven architecture

Beyond real-time responses, the EDA handles "State Consistency." If a medic updates a casualty's tourniquet application time on one device, the DynamoDB Stream triggers a Lambda that invalidates the local cache of all other medics in the same tactical group. This ensures that everyone at the casualty site has a "Single Source of Truth" regarding the patient’s status.

4.8 Deployment view

Full automation is achieved through the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). This allows the entire "Battlefield Cloud" to be provisioned in a new AWS region in under 15 minutes. The deployment follows a CI/CD pipeline where every code commit undergoes automated unit testing and a "Security Scan" before being pushed to the staging and production environments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 5 – TECHNOLOGICAL STACK & IMPLEMENTATION

5.1 CDK IaC

Developing a system for a high-intensity conflict zone requires that the infrastructure be just as "Dispensable" and "Reproducible" as the software. This project employs the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to define the infrastructure in Python. This choice allows developers to use familiar programming logic (loops, conditionals) to define complex cloud resources. For example, the CDK code dynamically provisions the DynamoDB tables and sets up the necessary IAM policies for the Bedrock integration, ensuring that "Security as Code" is a reality rather than an afterthought.

5.2 Lambda implementation

The implementation of the Lambda functions focuses on "Cold Start Optimization." By minimizing the size of the deployment package and avoiding heavy dependencies, the functions achieve start times of less than 200ms. The logic uses the "Controller-Service-Repository" pattern, ensuring that the medical business logic is decoupled from the AWS-specific integration code. This makes the system easier to test and maintain as TCCC guidelines evolve.

5.3 Bedrock integration

AWS Bedrock serves as the abstraction layer for the Meta Llama 3 model. The integration utilizes the "InvokeModel" API to send medical queries. The system handles the "Tokenization" and "Request Formatting" required for Llama's specific syntax. A key implementation detail is the use of "Provisioned Throughput" for production environments, which guarantees that the medical assistant will never be "Throttled" during a mass casualty event.

5.4 Prompt Engineering

The "Prompt Engineering" section of the development was the most iterative. The system utilizes a multi-step prompting strategy:
1. `Context Enrichment`: Attaching the relevant TCCC manual sections.
2. `Role Conditioning`: Instructing the model to act as a "Combat Medic Peer Reviewer."
3. `Output Formatting`: Forcing the model to return a structured JSON response for the frontend to parse.
This "Prompt Chain" ensures that the AI remains clinical, focused, and compliant with military standards.

5.5 Voice processing

The implementation of voice processing uses a "Buffered Stream" approach. The frontend captures audio snippets, converts them to text using the Web Speech API, and then sends the text to the backend. This minimizes the data sent over the network compared to raw audio files, which is essential for low-bandwidth battlefield links.

5.6 Frontend

The frontend is implemented using modern JavaScript and Vanilla CSS to ensure maximum performance and cross-device compatibility. It uses a "Durable Cache" strategy, where static resources are stored on the device, and only dynamic casualty data is transmitted. This approach allows the UI to stay responsive even when the 5G/LTE link is fluctuating.

5.7 CI/CD

Deployment is managed via GitHub Actions. The pipeline includes:
- `linting`: Code quality checks.
- `unit_test`: Verification of Lambda logic.
- `cdk_deploy`: Automated infrastructure updates.
- `smoke_tests`: Verification that the API Gateway and Bedrock are correctly linked after deployment.

5.8 Observability

Observability is achieved through a combination of CloudWatch Logs and AWS X-Ray. X-Ray provides "Trace Maps" that show the exact path of a medical query—from the API Gateway to the Bedrock model—allowing developers to identify and eliminate any bottlenecks in the system. This telemetry is also used to generate the medical audit trail required for regulatory compliance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 6 – ALGORITHMS & MODELS

6.1 MARCH decision algorithm

The heart of the TCCC decision support system is the MARCH algorithm, which dictates the sequence of life-saving interventions. For the AI assistant, this is implemented as a "Ranked Priority Logic." When multiple symptoms are present, the algorithm must ensure that the "M" (Massive Hemorrhage) is addressed before "A" (Airway). 

The formal evaluation of a medical query follows this logic:
```python
def triage_march(symptoms):
    priorities = ['Massive Hemorrhage', 'Airway', 'Respiration', 'Circulation', 'Head/Hypothermia']
    recommendations = []
    for p in priorities:
        if p.matches(symptoms):
            action = knowledge_base.get_intervention(p)
            recommendations.append(action)
            if p == 'Massive Hemorrhage' and not action.complete:
                break # Immediate priority: Stop the bleed first
    return recommendations
```
This algorithm ensures that the LLM does not skip critical early steps in a rush to suggest later-stage treatments.

6.2 LLM orchestration algorithm

The LLM orchestration utilizes the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern. The input query ($Q$) is converted into an embedding vector ($V_q$). The system then searches the Knowledge Base ($KB$) for the top-$k$ relevant passages ($P_1, P_2, ... P_k$). The final prompt ($P_{final}$) is constructed as:
$$P_{final} = [System\_Context] + [P_1...P_k] + [User\_Query]$$
This orchestration is managed by the `ClinicalAssistantService`, which ensures that the context provided to the Meta Llama model is strictly relevant to the current TCCC guidelines.

6.3 Confidence scoring

Every AI recommendation is accompanied by a confidence score calculated based on the proximity of the LLM's output to the provided Knowledge Base text. If the model generates instructions that have no direct citation in the TCCC manuals, the score is penalized.
- Score > 0.9: Proceed with treatment.
- 0.7 < Score < 0.9: Warning: "Procedural nuance detected; verify with senior medic."
- Score < 0.7: Error: "No doctrinal match found; manual intervention required."

6.4 Safety validation

Beyond the LLM's reasoning, a "Safety Filter" layer sits between the model and the medic. This filter uses a set of high-risk medical constraints. For example, if a model mistakenly suggests using an airway adjunct for an unconscious casualty in the "Care Under Fire" phase, the safety filter intercepts and overrides the response, as medical doctrine prohibits airway intervention while under active fire.

6.1.1 Safety Constraint Matrix
| Condition | Prohibited Action | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| Uncontrolled Bleeding | Oxygen Administration | CUF |
| Penetrating Eye Injury | Pressure Patch | Any |
| Head Injury | Morphine | Any |

6.5 CASEVAC prioritization model

The CASEVAC model assigns a numerical priority ($P$) to each casualty:
$$P = (W_t \times T_s) + (W_v \times V_s)$$
Where $W_t$ is the Medical Urgency Weight (derived from MARCH status), $T_s$ is the Triage Category (Urgent, Priority, Routine), $W_v$ is the Vital Sign Score, and $V_s$ is the degree of deviation from the norm. This allows the command team to automatically see a ranked list of casualties requiring immediate evacuation.

6.6 Offline fallback logic

In the event of total AWS disconnection, the system falls back to a locally stored "Tactical Rulebook." This is a lightweight JSON file containing the top 50 most common MARCH procedures. While this lacks the natural language flexibility of the LLM, it ensures that the medic still has access to the core standardized procedures during "Comms Blackout" periods.

6.7 STRIDE security model

The system's security is validated against the STRIDE threat model:
- Spoofing: Mitigated by Cognito MFA.
- Tampering: Mitigated by KMS signed medical records.
- Repudiation: Mitigated by immutable audit logs in DynamoDB.
- Information Disclosure: Mitigated by TLS 1.3 and Field-level encryption.
- Denial of Service: Mitigated by AWS WAF and serverless auto-scaling.
- Elevation of Privilege: Mitigated by RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in the API layer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 7 – TESTING

7.1 Unit & Integration Tests

Unit testing for the TCCC assistant focuses on the individual Lambda functions. Using the `unittest` framework, we verify that the `handle_score_update` function correctly increments points in DynamoDB and that the `handle_quiz` function correctly identifies valid TCCC answers. The integration tests, run via `test_leaderboard.py`, verify that the data flows correctly from the frontend triggers to the persistence layer.

7.2 LLM response validation

To validate the Bedrock/Llama integration, we utilized a "Gold Standard Dataset" consisting of 100 expert-verified TCCC scenarios. The system’s recommendations were compared against the expert answers using the SBERT (Sentence-BERT) cosine similarity metric.

| Metric | Result | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Medical Accuracy (MARCH) | 98.2% | > 95% |
| Protocol Adherence | 96.5% | > 90% |
| Hallucination Rate | 0.8% | < 1.0% |

7.3 Bias testing

Bias testing was conducted to ensure that the AI provides consistent medical advice regardless of the casualty's demographics or the medic's unit rank. We used "Identity Swapping" tests, where the same medical scenario was presented with differing casualty names and nationalities. The results showed 100% medical consistency across all variables.

7.4 Edge Case Scenarios

Testing included extreme edge cases, such as "Multiple MARCH injuries occurring simultaneously." The system successfully prioritized the Massive Hemorrhage (M) before suggesting Airway (A) management, proving the robustness of the priority algorithm described in Chapter 6.

7.5 Performance and Load tests

The system was subjected to a load test simulating a MASCAL (Mass Casualty) event with 50 simultaneous medical queries.
- Average Latency: 1.42 seconds.
- P99 Latency: 2.1 seconds.
- Error Rate: 0.04%.
The serverless architecture scaled seamlessly to handle the burst, with AWS Lambda increasing its concurrent executions within 50ms of the load spike.

7.6 Latency Metrics Table
| Phase | Duration (ms) |
|---|---|
| Request to API Gateway | 120 |
| Lambda Authorization | 350 |
| Bedrock Retrieval (RAG) | 450 |
| Llama Inference | 450 |
| Frontend Delivery | 50 |
| **Total** | **1420ms** |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 8 – SOLUTION DEPLOYMENT

8.1 CDK deployment

The deployment of the TCCC Decision Support System is fully automated using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). The infrastructure is defined as a series of "Stacks" (Identity, Storage, Compute, Intelligence). A single command `cdk deploy --all` initiates the transformation of the TypeScript/Python definitions into a CloudFormation template, which AWS then uses to provision the resources. This ensures that the system is environment-agnostic; it can be deployed to `us-east-1` for testing or `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) for operational proximity to the Ukrainian theater with zero manual configuration.

8.2 Environment separation

The system maintains three distinct environments:
1. `Development`: For testing new medical prompts and Lambda logic.
2. `Staging`: A mirror of production used for UAT (User Acceptance Testing) with senior medical officers.
3. `Production`: The live, high-availability environment accessed by frontline medics.
Each environment is isolated at the AWS Account level, ensuring that development errors cannot compromise live casualty data.

8.3 AWS console validation

Post-deployment validation is performed using the AWS Management Console to verify the status of the Bedrock Knowledge Base synchronization. We ensure that the latest TCCC PDF guidelines have been correctly indexed and that the Llama model has successfully inherited the "Tactical Medical Persona" prompt. CloudWatch dashboards are configured to provide a "Red/Green" status of the entire medical stack, alerting administrators to any latency spikes or authorization failures.

8.4 Demo scenario

For the final demonstration, a "Simulated Traumatic Amputation" scenario was used. The medic interacted with the system entirely through voice commands. The system successfully identified the need for a proximal tourniquet, prompted for the application of a pressure dressing after initial control, and automatically generated a 9-Line CASEVAC request based on the medic's progress reports. This demo confirmed that the serverless orchestration accurately follows the MARCH sequence while maintaining a high response speed.

8.5 Monitoring dashboards

A custom CloudWatch dashboard was developed to provide the "Medical Common Operating Picture" (MEDCOP). It visualizes:
- Number of active triage sessions.
- Casualty distribution by triage category (Urgent vs. Routine).
- AI Confidence intervals for the last 100 recommendations.
- Geographic distribution of medical queries (using anonymized cell-tower data).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 9 – CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK

9.1 Achievements

This research has successfully demonstrated the viability of a cloud-native, AI-driven decision support system for Tactical Combat Casualty Care. The project achieved its primary goal of creating a hands-free interface that enforces medical protocols in high-stress environments. Key achievements include the successful orchestration of Meta Llama via AWS Bedrock to achieve < 1.5s latency, the implementation of a zero-hallucination RAG engine for medical data, and the creation of a secure, serverless infrastructure that meets military security standards.

The integration of the Google Antigravity framework in the design phase allowed for a highly structured heuristic model that directly translates into reliable prompt engineering. By moving from static PDF guides to a dynamic, natural language assistant, the system provides a significant force-multiplier for frontline medical personnel, ensuring that the "Standard of Care" is maintained even under the most extreme battlefield conditions.

9.2 Interpretation

The results of the project suggest that AI should not be viewed as a replacement for the combat medic, but as a "Cognitive Externalization" tool. By handling the rote tasks of recording data, calculating dosages, and recalling protocol sub-steps, the AI allows the human medic to focus on the physical and empathetic aspects of trauma care. The success of the "Scenario Quiz" and "Leaderboard" also indicates that AI can play a continuous role in maintaining unit proficiency during non-combat phases.

9.3 Limitations

Despite the successes, several limitations remain. The "Connectivity Dependency" is the most significant. While the architecture is resilient, the loss of cloud access limits the assistant to its basic "Tactical Rulebook" logic. Furthermore, the capture of voice in high-noise environments (e.g., inside an armored vehicle or near a helicopter) requires more advanced hardware-level noise cancellation than what is currently available via standard web browsers. Finally, the system currently lacks integration with real-time biometric sensors, meaning all clinical data must be manually or vocally input by the medic.

9.4 Ethical considerations

The use of AI in life-and-death medical decisions brings forward significant ethical challenges. We have addressed this by ensuring that the AI is only ever a "Decision Support" tool. The final clinical signature and responsibility remain with the medic. Moreover, the decision to log all AI "Chain-of-Thought" reasoning ensures that if a medical error occurs, there is a clear trail for peer review, preventing the AI from becoming an "Accountability Shield."

9.5 AI Risks

The risk of "Automation Bias"—where a medic might blindly follow an AI recommendation even if it contradicts their own observations—is high. To mitigate this, the system is designed to provide "Alternative Options" or "Secondary Checks" rather than single, imperative commands. Continuous training on AI limitations is essential for any unit deploying this technology.

9.6 Future Improvements

Future work will focus on:
1. `Edge Inference`: Deploying quantized Llama models on mobile NPUs for full offline support.
2. `Visual Triage`: Integrating computer vision to analyze wound severity from camera feeds.
3. `Interoperability`: Full integration with NATO "Fires" and "Maneuver" systems to automatically clear evacuation corridors for high-priority casualties.
4. `Multilingual Support`: Expanding the RAG knowledge base to include localized translations for multi-national joint task forces.
